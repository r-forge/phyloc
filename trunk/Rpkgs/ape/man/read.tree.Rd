\usage{
read.tree(file = "", text = NULL, tree.names = NULL,
          skip = 0, comment.char = "#", ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{a file name specified by either a variable of mode character,
    or a double-quoted string; if \code{file = ""} (the default) then the
    tree is input on the keyboard, the entry being terminated with a
    blank line.}
  \item{text}{alternatively, the name of a variable of mode character
    which contains the tree(s) in parenthetic format. By default, this
    is ignored (set to \code{NULL}, meaning that the tree is read in a
    file); if \code{text} is not \code{NULL}, then the argument
    \code{file} is ignored.}
  \item{tree.names}{if there are several trees to be read, a vector of
    mode character that gives names to the individual trees; if
    \code{NULL} (the default), the trees are named \code{"tree1"},
    \code{"tree2"}, ...}
  \item{skip}{the number of lines of the input file to skip before
    beginning to read data (this is passed directly to\code{ scan()}).}
  \item{comment.char}{a single character, the remaining of the line
    after this character is ignored (this is passed directly to
    \code{scan()}).}
  \item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to \code{scan()}.}
}
\description{
  This function reads a file which contains one or several trees in
  parenthetic format known as the Newick or New Hampshire format.
}
\details{
  The default option for \code{file} allows to type directly the tree on
  the keyboard (or possibly to copy from an editor and paste in R's
  console) with, e.g., \code{mytree <- read.tree()}.

  `read.tree' tries to represent correctly trees with a badly
  represented root edge (i.e. with an extra pair of parentheses). For
  instance, the tree "((A:1,B:1):10);" will be read like "(A:1,B:1):10;"
  but a warning message will be issued in the former case as this is
  apparently not a valid Newick format. If there are two root edges
  (e.g., "(((A:1,B:1):10):10);"), then the tree is not read and an error
  message is issued.
}
\value{
  an object of class \code{"phylo"} with the following components:
  \item{edge}{a two-column matrix of mode numeric where each row
    represents an edge of the tree; the nodes and the tips are
    symbolized with numbers; the tips are numbered 1, 2, \dots, and the
    nodes are numbered after the tips. For each row, the first column
    gives the ancestor.}
  \item{edge.length}{(optional) a numeric vector giving the lengths of the
    branches given by \code{edge}.}
  \item{tip.label}{a vector of mode character giving the names of the
    tips; the order of the names in this vector corresponds to the
    (positive) number in \code{edge}.}
  \item{Nnode}{the number of (internal) nodes.}
  \item{node.label}{(optional) a vector of mode character giving the
    names of the nodes.}
  \item{root.edge}{(optional) a numeric value giving the length of the
    branch at the root if it exists.}

  If several trees are read in the file, the returned object is of class
  \code{c("multi.tree", "phylo")}, and is a list of objects of class
  \code{"phylo"}.
