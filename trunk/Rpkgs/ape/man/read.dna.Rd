\title{Read DNA Sequences in a File}
\usage{
read.dna(file, format = "interleaved", skip = 0,
         nlines = 0, comment.char = "#", seq.names = NULL,
         as.character = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{a file name specified by either a variable of mode character,
    or a double-quoted string.}
  \item{format}{a character string specifying the format of the DNA
    sequences. Three choices are possible: \code{"interleaved"},
    \code{"sequential"}, or \code{"fasta"}, or any unambiguous
    abbreviation of these.}
  \item{skip}{the number of lines of the input file to skip before
    beginning to read data.}
  \item{nlines}{the number of lines to be read (by default the file is
    read untill its end).}
  \item{comment.char}{a single character, the remaining of the line
    after this character is ignored.}
  \item{seq.names}{the names to give to each sequence; by default the
    names read in the file are used.}
  \item{as.character}{a logical controlling whether to return the
    sequences as an object of class \code{"DNAbin"} (the default).}
}
\description{
  This function reads DNA sequences in a file, and returns a matrix or a
  list of DNA sequences with the names of the taxa read in the file as
  rownames or names, respectively. By default, the sequences are stored
  in binary format, otherwise (if \code{as.character = "TRUE"}) in lower
  case.
}
\details{
  This function follows the interleaved and sequential formats defined
  in PHYLIP (Felsenstein, 1993) but with the original feature than there
  is no restriction on the lengths of the taxa names (though a data file
  with 10-characters-long taxa names is fine as well). For these two
  formats, the first line of the file must contain the dimensions of the
  data (the numbers of taxa and the numbers of nucleotides); the
  sequences are considered as aligned and thus must be of the same
  lengths for all taxa. For the FASTA format, the conventions defined in
  the URL below (see References) are followed; the sequences are taken as
  non-aligned. For all formats, the nucleotides can be arranged in any
  way with blanks and line-breaks inside (with the restriction that the
  first ten nucleotides must be contiguous for the interleaved and
  sequential formats, see below). The names of the sequences are read in
  the file unless the `seq.names' option is used. Particularities for
  each format are detailed below.

  \item{Interleaved:}{the function starts to read the sequences when it
    finds 10 contiguous characters belonging to the ambiguity code of
    the IUPAC (namely A, C, G, T, U, M, R, W, S, Y, K, V, H, D, B, and
    N, upper- or lowercase, so you might run into trouble if you have a
    taxa name with 10 contiguous letters among these!) All characters
    before the sequences are taken as the taxa names after removing the
    leading and trailing spaces (so spaces in a taxa name are
    allowed). It is assumed that the taxa names are not repeated in the
    subsequent blocks of nucleotides.}

  \item{Sequential:}{the same criterion than for the interleaved format
    is used to start reading the sequences and the taxa names; the
    sequences are then read until the number of nucleotides specified in
    the first line of the file is reached. This is repeated for each taxa.}

  \item{FASTA:}{This looks like the sequential format but the taxa names
    (or rather a description of the sequence) are on separate lines
    beginning with a `greater than' character ``>'' (there may be
    leading spaces before this character). These lines are taken as taxa
    names after removing the ``>'' and the possible leading and trailing
    spaces. All the data in the file before the first sequence is ignored.}
