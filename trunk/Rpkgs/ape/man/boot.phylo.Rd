\arguments{
  \item{phy}{an object of class \code{"phylo"}.}
  \item{x}{in the case of \code{boot.phylo}: a taxa (rows) by characters
    (columns) matrix; this may be presented as a list; in the case of
    \code{print} and \code{plot}: an object of class \code{"prop.part"}.}
  \item{FUN}{the function used to estimate \code{phy} (see details).}
  \item{B}{the number of bootstrap replicates.}
  \item{block}{the number of columns in \code{x} that will be resampled
    together (see details).}
  \item{\dots}{either (i) a single object of class \code{"phylo"}, (ii) a
    series of such objects separated by commas, or (iii) a list
    containing such objects. In the case of \code{plot} further
    arguments for the plot (see details).}
  \item{check.labels}{a logical specifying whether to check the labels
    of each tree. If \code{FALSE} (the default), it is assumed that all
    trees have the same tip labels, and that they are in the same order
    (see details).}
  \item{part}{a list of partitions as returned by \code{prop.part}; if
    this is used then \code{\dots} is ignored.}
  \item{object}{an object of class \code{"prop.part"}.}
  \item{barcol}{the colour used for the bars displaying the number of
    partitions in the upper panel.}
  \item{leftmar}{the size of the margin on the left to display the tip
    labels.}
}
\description{
  These functions analyse bipartitions found in a series of trees.

  \code{prop.part} counts the number of bipartitions found in a series
  of trees given as \code{\dots}.

  \code{prop.clades} counts the number of times the bipartitions present
  in \code{phy} are present in a series of trees given as \code{\dots} or
  in the list previously computed and given with \code{part}.

  \code{boot.phylo} performs a bootstrap analysis.
}
\details{
  The argument \code{FUN} in \code{boot.phylo} must be the function used
  to estimate the tree from the original data matrix. Thus, if the tree
  was estimated with neighbor-joining (see \code{nj}), one maybe wants
  something like \code{FUN = function(xx) nj(dist.dna(xx))}.

  \code{block} in \code{boot.phylo} specifies the number of columns to
  be resampled altogether. For instance, if one wants to resample at the
  codon-level, then \code{block = 3} must be used.

  Using (the default) \code{check.labels = FALSE} in \code{prop.part}
  results in considerable decrease in computing times. This requires that
  (i) all trees have the same tip labels, \emph{and} (ii) these labels
  are ordered similarly in all trees (in other words, the element
  \code{tip.label} are identical in all trees).

  The plot function represents a contingency table of the different
  partitions (on the \emph{x}-axis) in the lower panel, and their observed
  numbers in the upper panel. Any further arguments (\dots) are used to
  change the aspects of the points in the lower panel: these may be
  \code{pch}, \code{col}, \code{bg}, \code{cex}, etc. This function
  works only if there is an attribute \code{labels} in the object.

  The print method displays the partitions and their numbers. The
  summary method extracts the numbers only.
}
\note{
  \code{prop.clades} calls internally \code{prop.part} with the option
  \code{check.labels = TRUE}, which may be very slow. If the trees
  passed as \code{\dots} fulfills conditions (i) and (ii) above, then it
  might be faster to first call, e.g., \code{pp <- prop.part(...)}, then
  use the option \code{part}: \code{prop.clades(phy, part = pp)}.
}
\value{
  \code{prop.part} returns an object of class \code{"prop.part"} which
  is a list with an attribute \code{"number"}. The elements of this list
  are the observed clades, and the attribute their respective
  numbers. If the default \code{check.labels = FALSE} is used, an
  attribute \code{"labels"} is added, and the vectors of the returned
  object contains the indices of these labels instead of the labels
  themselves.

  \code{prop.clades} and \code{boot.phylo} return a numeric vector
  which \emph{i}th element is the number associated to the \emph{i}th
  node of \code{phy}.

  \code{summary} returns a numeric vector.
