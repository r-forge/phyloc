	'birthdeath.simulation' simulates a series of birth death 
	phylogenetic trees for a given period of time. Trees are
	save to two files containing trees with extinct taxa and 
	recostructed trees with extant tips only.

	'birthdeath.tree' simulates a single birth death 
	phylogenetic tree for a given period of time.

	'extract.sister' extracts all sister species(cherries)
	from an object of class "phy".

	'lagtime.batch' models a lag-time to species formation 
	along a batch of phylogenetic trees simulated using 
	'birthdeath.simulation' and deletes nodes classified as 
	intraspecific splits.
	
	'lagtime' models a lag-time to species formation along a
	phylogenetic tree and deletes nodes classified as intraspecific
	splits.

	'readPhySim.tree' reads phylogenetic trees in a compatible format.

	'writePhySim.tree' writes phylogenetic trees in a compatible 		format.
