replacement methods
   (in root.edge<- style, perhaps also setRoot style)

summary: if tip and node don't have identical colnames,
   don't try to get alldata

and/or: more stringent tests e.g.
 column names match in tip and node (if all.data)?

ORDER: cladewise, pruningwise, drag reorder from ape

match w/ OUCH:  root node doesn't have corresponding
   entry in the edge matrix: ouch adds a row to the edge matrix
   (1-row data frame matching node column info)

rewrite methods in native phylo4 as necessary/desirable

plot method for phylo4d: what would be a good default?

figure out best way to deal with namespace/conflicts
(override ape methods)

identify.node

implement "data class" by wrapping data.frame and
writing an [ accessor method

check multiPhylo!
"unpack"/"pack" methods

lapply/multiple-tree methods, or at least documentation
  on how to do it

tree walking/generic manipulation methods

TreeLib wrapper???

I/O

more tree manipulation methods
compare: Mesquite, ape (check O'Meara list)

change name to phylobase

compare Sidlauskas wiki documentation, how would
one do it in phylo4?

digits= arg for some summaries etc.?

add vector method for data in phylo4d constructor
